        "The strong should aid and protect the weak. Then, the weak will become
        strong, and they in turn will aid and protect those weaker than them.
        That is the law of nature." Things don't go exactly the way we want them
        to. We're only human. You get to decide where your happiness comes from.
        What's important is now.
